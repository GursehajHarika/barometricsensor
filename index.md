# Week 12


Here is my Raspberry Pi's case design that is going to be made and will be updated

[![design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43185907/48804390-79801000-ece2-11e8-9a68-08e2eff1f0b7.png)](https://github.com/GursehajHarika/barometricsensor/blob/master/PiGursehajHarika.cdr)

This is the final Product, the reason its so tall is that it can hold multiple sensors as our project includes more than one sensor, this case was designed in house to incroperate [Arman Velani](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer)  's 3-Axis Accelerometer.

# Week 11

The Sensor was plugged into the Raspberry Pi 3's GPIO and was stacked with [Arman Velani](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer)  's 3-Axis Accelerometer. i can happily say both sensors worked like a charm. We Ran into some weird problem while running the python code that would read data from the sensor and display it on the screen for the 3axis- accelerometer. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/index.md)

And this  is how My sensor readings look like and the python [code](https://github.com/GursehajHarika/barometricsensor/blob/master/ms5611.py) that i used which i found on [this](http://www.pibits.net/code/raspberry-pi-and-ms5611-barometric-pressure-sensor-example.php) wesite.

# Week 10


PCB Soldering 

This week, the PCB i designed was made.this is the first time i created my own PCB. I soldered a 12 header pin on the PCB which was then used to attached my sensor to the PCB which could later be used to connect to the raspberry pi.

# Week 9 

This week, the PCB was design was completed and sen it to the Prototype lab of Humber college, below is the schmetic of the PCB which shows the connection between the 12 header pin and the raspberry pi GPIO pins.

# Week 8

BreadBoarding


Making a breadboard was easy, once  the sensor's documentation was well written and helped me alot in making the connections.
