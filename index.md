# Week 11

The Sensor was plugged into the Raspberry Pi 3's GPIO and was stacked with Arman Velani [ArmanSensor](https://github.com/ArmanVelani/3-AxisAccelerometer/blob/master/index.md)  's 3-Axis Accelerometer. i can happily say both sensors worked like a charm. My sensor "Sensor' Link "

# Week 10


PCB Soldering 

This week, the PCB i designed was made.this is the first time i created my own PCB. I soldered a 12 header pin on the PCB which was then used to attached my sensor to the PCB which could later be used to connect to the raspberry pi.

# Week 9 

This week, the PCB was design was completed and sen it to the Prototype lab of Humber college, below is the schmetic of the PCB which shows the connection between the 12 header pin and the raspberry pi GPIO pins.
